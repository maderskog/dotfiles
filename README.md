Description
========

This is my dotfiles. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This far, it covers:
* vim
* zsh
* git
* tmux

Planning to add:
* OS X
* bash
* iTerm

Still thinking about:
* ssh


Caveats
=======

I have only tested this on Mac OS X.

You do need a terminal that handles unicode characters, [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) for example...


Installation
============

In your home directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/maderskog/dotfiles.git
    $ cd dotfiles
    $ ./setup

Oh, and do change your default shell to zsh, of course :)

    $ sudo chsh -s zsh <yourusername>
